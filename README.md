# 3D Interactive Portfolio with A-Frame

This project showcases a 3D interactive portfolio created using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. The portfolio is designed to present your work in an engaging, immersive, and interactive manner. Users can navigate the 3D space, interact with elements, and explore your projects in a visually appealing environment.

## Features

- **Immersive 3D Environment:** A fully navigable 3D scene that represents your portfolio.
- **Interactive Elements:** Clickable and dynamic objects to showcase projects, skills, and other highlights.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across desktop, mobile, and VR devices.

## Deployment on GitHub Pages

1. Ensure your repository is pushed to GitHub.
2. Navigate to your repository's settings on GitHub.
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main`) and set the folder to `/ (root)` or `docs/` if you store the portfolio files in a `docs` folder.
5. Click **Save** and GitHub Pages will generate a public link to your portfolio.
6. Visit the provided URL to view your interactive portfolio live!
